This patch is for the edison-src-ww25.5-15.tgz version of the edison 
software.  You must download that from the Intel website.  Then simply
untar it and apply the patch ex:

tar xf edison-src-ww25.5-15.tgz -C "${BUILDDIR}"
cd "${BUILDDIR}"
patch -p0 -N -r /tmp/rejects  < /path/to/src_build.patch

At this point you will have everything setup and you can build just like
normal, see instructions from Intel documentation but the following 
should work:

make setup
make image

To be able to update the backup battery charge current and read it
there is a file  /sys/devices/platform/pmic_ccsm/backup_battery_charge

#set charge to 3.0V 500 uA
echo 27 > /sys/devices/platform/pmic_ccsm/backup_battery_charge

See the Edison Compute Module Hardware Guide for more instructions
on proper register settings.
